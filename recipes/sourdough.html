    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Bread recipes have been passed down through the evolution of man. Sourdough bread particularly dates back thousands of years and is belived to have been made by Egyptians. Due to sourdough bread having self leavaning properties, it is understandable how ancient human cultures used this property to thier advantage.</p>
    <p>Sourdough bread at its most basic form is the product of mixing flour and water. This mixture alone does not produce the delicous taste that fans of sourdough bread know. The flour and water mixture is left to sit for a long time in a preferably warm, moist area to allow fermentation. Most people know these conditions create the ideal living environment for microorganisms. Think of the bread loaf as the environment that the natural yeasts which live on grains and even on your skin grow. This process takes time, often 8-10 hours. The growth of these natural yeasts and their gassy by-product are what give sourdough bread its unique and delicious taste!</p>
    <p>This recipe is made with both a sourdough starter and commercial active yeast. The commercial yeast in this recipe allows us to make a loaf of sourdough bread in <strong><em>90 minutes</em></strong> instead of a entire day like it took our bread-making ancestors. The use of the starter is what provides this loaf the natual yeast taste and why we can call this a sourdough bread recipe.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>150 g</strong> ripe sourdough starter, at room temperature</li>
        <li><strong>300 g</strong> water, lukewarm</li>
        <li><strong>480 g</strong> artsian bread flour</li>
        <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> rapid rise yeast</li>
        <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> salt</li>
        <li><strong>2 tsp</strong> granualted sugar</li>
        <li>olive oil, to make proofing bowl non-stick</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Measure the starter to a large bowl and pour in the water. Stir well with dough hook to combine.</li>
        <li>Add the flour and yeast. Stir again to combine and make sure there are no dry pockets of flour.</li>
        <li>Add sugar and salt next – continue mixing with your dough hook or you can use your hands. Your dough will be very sticky and shaggy.</li>
        <li>Spray the bowl with olive oil, cover the bowl with a clean towel and place somewhere warm to rise. You can place it in the microwave or the oven with a pot of boiling water. The steam will speed up the process.</li>
        <li>Check the dough has doubled in size. This should take only an hour but if your room or ingredients are cold it can take <em><strong>up to</strong></em> 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Mist your countertop with olive oil and scrape the dough on it. Use an oiled bench spaper to fold the edges over towards the centre to create a round loaf. Oil a square of parchment paper and transfer the loaf onto it.</li>
        <li>Lift the paper by the edges and place in a bowl to rise for a further 30 minutes. Meanwhile, place your cast iron pot in the oven and preheat to 220°C (420°F).</li>           
        <li>Lift the bread out of the bowl using the baking paper and carefully drop into the pot (be careful it will be very hot). Score the top using a knife (if the dough is very sticky then you can skip the scoring). Cover the pot and bake for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>  Uncover and bake for 15 more minutes. Carefully remove the bread from the pot – it should sound hollow if tapped on the underside. Cool completely on a wire rack before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
