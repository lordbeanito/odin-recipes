    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>For anyone who loves their italian cuisine, pasta is often on the plate. If you've never made pasta yourself you may be surprised how extraordinarily simple it is to make! </p>
    <p>Although you don't technically need any fancy kitchen equipment for this recipe, there are a few handy tools available which allows making this homemade pasta recipe a breeze. <em><strong>Food processors</strong></em> are great for mixing the ingredients together evenly. Pasta dough is often sticky and tough which can make hand mixing a bit of a workout. <em><strong>Pasta makers</strong></em>, whether it be a manual hand crank or Kitchen-Aid attachment, make the actual pasta shaping process quick and easy. They have a feature that allows you to flatten your dough to the thickness you want and will also cut your pasta sheets into strings. There are some fancy pasta machines that have other features such as a ravioli press but, if you get really into pasta making I highly suggest getting yourself one! <em><strong>Drying racks</strong></em> are another great tool for homemade pasta as they allow air flow over the pasta which helps dry it fast and as a plus, the pasta strings don't get stuck to each other.</p>
    <p>Okay, now that we've talked about the hardware involved in the art of pasta making, let's look at how we can make our homemade pasta without all the bells and whistles.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>4</strong> large eggs, room temperature</li>
        <li><strong>2 1/2 cups</strong> all purpose flour (or flour blend)</li>
        <li><strong>1 Tbsp</strong> olive oil</li>
        <li><strong>1 tsp</strong> fine sea salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the flour in a mound on a large cutting board. Use your fingers or a spoon to create a good-sized well in the middle of the flour mound (kind of like a volcano). Add the eggs in the center of the well. Sprinkle the salt and drizzle the olive oil on top of the eggs.</li>
        <li>Use a fork to begin whisking the eggs until they are combined. Then begin to gradually whisk some of the surrounding flour into the egg mixture, adding more and more until the egg mixture is nice and thick. <em>If some eggs accidentally spill out, no worries, just use your hands or a bench scraper to pull them back in</em> Use your hands to fold in the rest of the dough until it forms a loose ball. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until the dough is smooth and elastic, sprinkling some extra flour on the cutting board if needed to prevent sticking or if they dough seems too wet or sticky. If the dough seems too dry, add in an extra tablespoon or two of water, but you want the dough to be fairly dry.</li>
        <li>Form the dough into a ball with your hands and wrap it tightly in plastic wrap. Let the dough rest at room temperature for 30 minutes. Use immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 day.</li>
        <li>Roll out the pasta dough into your desired shape, either by hand or using a pasta maker. Cook the pasta in a large pot of generously-salted boiling water until it is al dente, usually between 1-5 minutes depending on the thickness of your pasta. Drain and use immediately.</li>
    </ol>
