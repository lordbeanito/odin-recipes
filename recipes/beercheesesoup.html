    <h2 class="heading">Description</h2>
    <p>Melty, creamy and <em>full</em> of flavor, this delicious beer cheese soup recipe will warm anyone up on a cold day. What's not to love, it's made with cheese and beer!</p>
    <p>All cooked in one pot for easy clean up, we recommend this hearty soup for any occasion. Whether it's just for two or for the whole family, a steamy cup of beer cheese soup served with a slice of warm sourdough bread never fails to hit the spot. The idea of soup made of cheese and beer was originally birthed in the mid-west and can be made with many variations from the type of beer you use to wide variety of cheeses available at the supermarket. Some like their soup with a kick by adding a fresh jalapeños, shredded pepper jack cheese or both, for those of us who like it extra spicy. We do recommend using a sharp cheddar cheese to whatever cheese blend you choose to add a tangy dimension to your soup. Enough about the cheese though, let's get this recipe started!</p>
